Iâ€™m a developer from Sweden who enjoys building fullstack applications, optimizing my workflow, and crafting good software.
I value craftsmanship, continuous improvement, and the creative process itself.

Right now, Iâ€™m looking for a role where I can grow as fullstack developer, ideally working with Go or Node.js, with a focused team that values impact and collaboration.

Oh, and before I forget: I use neovim btw.
